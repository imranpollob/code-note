## Remove file

```bash
rm file1.txt some-directory/file2.csv
```

## Remove folder

```bash
rm -rf folder-name
```

Here, `-r` means "recursive" and `-f` means "force" (suppress confirmation messages)

So, be careful ðŸ™ƒ

## Remove all from current folder

```bash
rm -rf *
```

Now its neat and clean
