## 10 Ways Developers Can Invest Time Instead of Wasting it

### 🎯 Set goals
Please define your goal. You __SHOULD__ do it. Try to visualize where you want to see your career in upcoming years. Plan accordingly.

### 💎 Prioritize things
Most developers have thousands of things (projects!!!) going on at any one time. The key is to focus only on what matters the most to move you toward your big goal.

You should align your time with your big picture priority. 

Everything else should go on the do-not-do-list!

### 🙅‍♀️ Say “No”
If you say yes to this, you automatically say no to something else. Because you can only do one thing at a time, is this thing more important than other things for achieving my goals?

### 📆 Less calls, less meetings

### 📬 Time for emails

### 🤖 Automate things
We are programmers; we naturally don’t like routine and doing repetitive tasks. If it happens to us twice or more, we are looking for ways to automate it.

### 🚀 Be in the moment
Our whole life is ruining because we think much more about the past and future. The __"NOW"__ is more important than anything.

> “Live life for the moment because everything else is uncertain.”―Louis Tomlinson

### 📊 Don’t swap money for time

### ⚡️ Ignore distractions
We live in a modern world where it is incredibly easy to get distracted, for example, via Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Prefer to invest your time in more important things that will make you closer to your goals and dreams

### 🤯 Stop letting other people’s opinions control you
